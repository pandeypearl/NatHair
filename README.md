# NatHair
This is my ALX/Holberton School Portfolio Project which aims to help people with their natural hair journey.

A few years ago, I had myself started my own natural hair journey, and initially I didn't realize what a daunting task it would be. I did not know anything about hair typing, what “hair porosity” meant and how important it would be, and most importantly, I had no idea what kind of products I needed in order to build my own hair regimen. This led me to waste a lot of time and money because I was using a very frustrating method called trial and error. I had absolutely no idea what I was doing and this led me to lose confidence in my decision to go natural. This experience is what led to the idea of NatHair. I decided to do my portfolio project about something that would have helped me in the past, and could possibly help those in a similar as not worked for you, allowing you to help out your fellow naturals.situation presently and in the future.

The outcome of this idea is a web application that helps you identify every aspect of your hair and its current condition, recommends the best possible products specific to you and your personal hair issues, and provides a community space to share what has and has not worked for you, allowing you to help out your fellow naturals.
